# MSBuild lab environment

Experiment with MSBuild

## Integration tests

Goal: Filter what test projects to run based on certain condition

Reason: Hinder slow running tests and tests that have external dependencies that might not be satisfied on the current machine

Hypothesis: Use MSBuild props/targets to achieve this
